        Discussion of my design and sketch for a C:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Below is my sketch:
    </p>
    <img src="assets/project%202%20sketch.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p>
        My thought process behind this design was to keep the center empty so that the person can use the mirror for its
        original function, while keeping the smart functions close and easily visible.
        The mirror was designed to be split into 3 columns:
        <ul>
            <li>the left one being more focused on time, concerning the user's schedule and top news stories</li>
            <li>the middle being focused on the user themself, with the time and weather being easily viewable without
                moving their eyes too much</li>
            <li>the right focusing more on the user's life and wellbeing, showing notifications from social media and
                their hours of sleep</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The main goal of this design was to make sure that the smart functions are not overpowering the mirror's
        original purpose.</p>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Explanation of my implementation and how my mirror works for a B
    </h3>
    <p>My implementation is in javascript using the p5.js library is at the bottom of the page. </p>
    <div>
        <script src="lib/p5.js"></script>
        <script src="sketch.js"></script>
    </div>
    <p>I was able to implement most of my sketch, having to omit the social feed items. The widgets were implemented
        as such:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The clock and date widgets were implemented using the Date() class</li>
            <li>The weather widget, and top stories widget were both implemented using APIs</li>
            <li>The schedule is implemented by reading from a csv file</li>
            <li>The time spent sleeping widget is hard coded</li>
        </ul>
    <p>The only part of the mirror that the user can interact with is the row of colored buttons at the bottom, which is
    the advanced feature and will be explained later in the report.
    </p>

        Explanation of the advanced feature and embedded presentation video for an A
    </h3>
    <p>The advanced feature I have implemented in my mirror is for it to act as a light source, with the default color
        being the mirror's "off" state. It can be used by clicking the colored buttons and the colors act as led lights,
        with the last button acting as an off switch, turning the led lights "off".</p>
